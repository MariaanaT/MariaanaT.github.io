### Spreading of COVID-19 

Study on the spreading of COVID-19 based on data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The dataset is updated daily. The results can be found from [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/cf01a0553caf7e804081e1bce966ac337651f6fc/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC.ipynb). The source code can be found from [here](https://github.com/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/master/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC.ipynb). There is [another notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/cf01a0553caf7e804081e1bce966ac337651f6fc/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC-Animations.ipynb) visualizing the spread of the COVID-19 globally e.g. with animations. The source code for this notebook is [here](https://github.com/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/master/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC-Animations.ipynb). The plots have been updated 20th Nov 2020. 

### The Effects of Nuclear Weapons Calculator 

Calculations are based on the equations and plots in the book The Effects of Nuclear Weapons. PDF version of the book can be found from [https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/](https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/), and the digital version of the slide rule accompaning the book can be found from [https://www.fourmilab.ch/bombcalc/](https://www.fourmilab.ch/bombcalc/). The aim of this project is to calculate all of the properties that are available in the slide rule, but currently, only some of these calculations are available. The source code can be found from [here](
https://github.com/MariaanaT/The-Effects-of-Nuclear-Weapons). 

### Craters on Mars

Are the craters equally distributed on the surface of the Mars? And is the depth or diameter of the craters dependent on the location of the crater? Find the answers [here](https://github.com/MariaanaT/MarsCraters/blob/master/MarsCratersStudy.ipynb). 

### Renewable Energy

If you are interested in how renewable energy is used in different countries of the world, see the project results from [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MariaanaT/RenewableElectricity/blob/931326f68d9bc04c85eff98d4407afe61019d684/RenewableElectricityOutput.ipynb). If you are just interested on the source code, go [here](https://github.com/MariaanaT/RenewableElectricity).
