### Spreading of COVID-19 

Study on the spreading of COVID-19 based on data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The dataset is updated weekly. The plots are updated twice a month or so, previous update has been done 30th Dec 2020. 

* The main results can be found from [this notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/ad478f9ae2e3405411f1cfd40340162fee89503e/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC.ipynb). Unfortunately, GitHub does not seem to support geographical plots. The source code can be found from [here](https://github.com/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/master/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC.ipynb). 
* There is [another notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/ad478f9ae2e3405411f1cfd40340162fee89503e/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC-Global%20Timeseries.ipynb) visualizing the spread of the COVID-19 globally using also animations. The source code for this notebook is [here](https://github.com/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/master/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC-Global%20Timeseries.ipynb). 
* There is [one notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/ad478f9ae2e3405411f1cfd40340162fee89503e/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC-Global.ipynb) to illustrate the cases and deaths globally, especially comparing the spread between different continents. The source code can be found from [here](https://github.com/MariaanaT/COVID-19-Dashboard/blob/master/COVID-19%20study%20ECDC-Global.ipynb).

### Searching Higgs boson with neural networks

This work aims to replicate work presented in the article [1]. The motivation for the work is described in the abstract of the paper: *"Collisions at high-energy particle colliders are a traditionally fruitful source of exotic particle discoveries. Finding these rare particles requires solving difficult signal-versus-background classification problems, hence machine learning approaches are often used. Standard approaches have relied on ‘shallow’ machine learning models that have a limited capacity to learn complex non-linear functions of the inputs [...]. Recent advances in the field of deep learning make it possible to learn more complex functions and better discriminate between signal and background classes."*

This work consists of two notebooks. In the [first notebook](https://github.com/MariaanaT/Higgs-DNN/blob/master/Higgs_DNN.ipynb), deep neural network is trained. In the [second notebook](https://github.com/MariaanaT/Higgs-DNN/blob/master/Higgs_shallow_NN.ipynb), shallow neural network is trained for comparison. For both networks accuracy and AUC (Area Under the Curve) are calculated so that model behavior can be compared. The aim was to replicate original work as closely as possible, but some modifications were needed especially for the deep neural network to achieve similar AUC as in the original work.

### The Effects of Nuclear Weapons Calculator 

Calculations are based on the equations and plots in the book The Effects of Nuclear Weapons. PDF version of the book can be found from [https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/](https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/), and the digital version of the slide rule accompaning the book can be found from [https://www.fourmilab.ch/bombcalc/](https://www.fourmilab.ch/bombcalc/). The aim of this project is to calculate all of the properties that are available in the slide rule, but currently, only some of these calculations are available. The source code can be found from [here](
https://github.com/MariaanaT/The-Effects-of-Nuclear-Weapons). 

### Craters on Mars

Are the craters equally distributed on the surface of the Mars? And is the depth or diameter of the craters dependent on the location of the crater? Find the answers [here](https://github.com/MariaanaT/MarsCraters/blob/master/MarsCratersStudy.ipynb). 

### Renewable Energy

If you are interested in how renewable energy is used in different countries of the world, see the project results from [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MariaanaT/RenewableElectricity/blob/931326f68d9bc04c85eff98d4407afe61019d684/RenewableElectricityOutput.ipynb).
